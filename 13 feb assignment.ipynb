    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python?\n",
    "Ans6. (i)Handle specific exceptions: Always try to catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic Exception class. This helps in identifying the exact error and taking appropriate action.\n",
    "(ii)Keep the try block small: Keep the code inside the try block as small as possible. This helps in narrowing down the scope of the exception and makes debugging easier.\n",
    "(iii)Use finally block: Always use a finally block to ensure that resources like files, network connections, and database connections are properly closed, even if an exception is raised."
